# employeetracker

## Description
 This employee tracker was designed to teach us how to use SQL to create a backend database and how to properly enter in information on employees to fill out the database. This information could have included their department, their role, their employee ID, etc. 

 ## Disclosures
 Outside of the starter code, I utilized a tutor, Alexis (once again, he was great!), and asked for help during office hours with my instructor. I also had help from the Xpert Learning Assistant to help write some of the server.js file code.

 Also--there are not many commits due to an error. I cloned the starter code, but never created a GitHub repo to track all of my changes until close to the end of development. That is my fault, and I accept any grade deduction that may come as a result. I treid to make the commit messages I had as descriptive as possible to give the grader as clear a picture as possible as to what each change/update was.
