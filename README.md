# employeetracker

## Description
 This employee tracker was designed to teach us how to use SQL to create a backend database and how to properly enter in information on employees to fill out the database. This information could have included their department, their role, their employee ID, etc. We can also add/view a department, update employee roles and departments, search for individual employees, etc. 

 ## Disclosures
 I utilized a tutor, Alexis (once again, he was great!), and asked for help during office hours with my instructor. I also had help from the Xpert Learning Assistant to help write some of the server.js file code and reorganize the employee.js file. Louis, my instructor, also helped to fix a few of the errors! I know there are a few still lingering.

 I ran out of free Screencastify videos, so I signed up for Loom. The video is here: https://www.loom.com/share/64f0efba257f4ca69b5d099fb454d050?sid=975c08e4-675c-4aa6-87b8-b5cc98130973
